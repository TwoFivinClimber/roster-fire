# Welcome To Roster Fire

## This Project was created to simulate a team roster for Paintball Teams


## Features 
- Users can Create Players and Teams that display Names, Images and Positions
- Users can Update Teams, and Players as things change throughout the season
- Users can Delete Teams and Players if no longer needed
- All these changes are reflected on the application in real time when editing

## Social Feature
- Users can view other teams that have been created by other people if those teams have been made public
- If another team is public, you can ask to acquire that team while trading for one of your own teams
- If the other user accepts the trade, the teams will be switched and you will have control of the acquired team.

### Happy Team Building !
